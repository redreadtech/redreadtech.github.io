                        When prioritising speed, you often have to sacrifice security, or vice versa. Intel decided that a 30% gain in speed was worth a small vulnerability in the system, but now the company is regretting that decision, because the vulnerability has been uncovered and exploited. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Oops</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Meltdown and Spectre facilitate access to protected information in a PC’s kernel memory, possibly allowing attackers to find passwords, photos, emails and anything else on your device.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        How is this possible? Because chips use a performance-enhancing feature called “speculative execution”, the CPU can learn and predict what a branch of a program might do. This, however, enables malicious apps to access protected memory and trick the computer into revealing secrets that it shouldn’t. 
                    </p>

                        This feature affects almost every device manufactured after 1995, especially those using Intel processing chips. Meltdown and Spectre, unlike most other computer-related issues, affect almost all kinds of device: Windows PC, Mac, Android, iPhone… everything.

                    <h3>I’m sure they’ll fix it</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Intel, ARM and AMD have been in the hot seat for patches, fixes and updates. These vulnerabilities are at an unprecedented scale for them, because they basically every modern chip they have manufactured.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Due to the panic at Intel, a nonsensical and “broken fix” for the vulnerabilities was released publicly before being hastily retracted. The creator of Linux publicly said this was “pure garbage”. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        After some issues, Intel has released fixes for some devices, but the major issue is that they have reversed their earlier decision – they’ve improved the security but sacrificed the speed. There are claims that the fixes might hamper the performance of your device up to 45%.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        The entire issue, including the vulnerabilities, the defective patches and the final speed compromises have obviously caused public vexation. For the companies involved, there is no real option other than to reduce the speed of their chips in some way. With current technology, it is unfortunate that you cannot have your code and eat it.
