            After the massive Facebook scandal, thousands of users have been quick to say that they would be deleting their accounts. They claimed that they felt that their privacy was at risk if they kept using the social networking site. They were not, however, as quick as Elon Musk in actually deleting their accounts, because social media is designed to keep us hooked.

        <h3>Wait for it…</h3>
                    
        <p>
            Using apps on your devices, you’ll notice little symbols which represent a loader – something that moves in anticipation of content to arrive. For example, you’ve almost certainly seen something like this:
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center">
            <img src="../RESOURCES/4/light_blue_material_design_loading.gif" class="w3-image w3-round-large w3-card">
        </p>

        <p>
            These animations are more than placeholders – they are designed to build anticipation and keep you watching. This is called persuasive design and creators are getting better at it. More interesting animations are likely to guarantee your focus:
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center">
            <img src="../RESOURCES/4/loading-animations-preloader-gifs-ui-ux-effects-18.gif">
        </p>
        
        <p>
            On social media, you’ll subconsciously learn to wait for these to finish loading, because if you don’t, you might miss out on something. This is a genuine fear that most people have – you dread meeting with your friends to find that they are well versed in the latest gossip that you don’t know anything about. 
        </p>
                    
        <h3>You don’t know your friends</h3>
                    
        <p>
            Think about the phrase above. That sounds strange, doesn’t it? Friends are people you know well and can always relate to, yet on social media, you’ll make friends that you’ve never seen in real life.
        </p>
                    
        <p>
            Just like you, they’ll robotically “like” everything on their feed which means your content is getting their appreciation. You feel good, knowing that your latest photo was “liked” by 500 people, but is it really of any worth when you don’t know half those people?
        </p>
                    
        <p>
            But at the crux of the issue is your real friends. They’re all on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram, etc. What if you begin to lose touch with them if you aren’t? To the social media user, quitting Instagram is the digital equivalent of growing old.
        </p>
                    
        <h3>Mind Control</h3>
                    
        <p>
            Designers are even using subtle psychological tricks to grab attention. For example, while using your phone, you don’t notice it, but everything is very colourful. If you turn on your phone’s grayscale mode, you’ll realise just how big the difference is. Apps use big, bold designs to make sure your mind cannot divert attention from them. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For example, the design of Instagram is such that, apart from the logo, the photos and the send button, there is no colour. This colour scheme is no coincidence; it is entirely intentional.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The logo appeals to the eye, making you want to click on it. The photos get more attention if the space around them is grayscale. And the send button is equally appealing. It’s the same with YouTube and, indeed, Facebook.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        
        <p>
           The average person spends 90 minutes on their phone every day. You could spend the same amount of time playing a full football match every day. Imagine how skilled at football you’d become.
