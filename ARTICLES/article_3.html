            These days, anyone can build their own websites within 15 minutes using free, online services such as Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, Wordpress – the list goes on. Superficially, it sounds fantastic. The internet is going to have many more websites and everyone can express themselves even more freely than they can on Social Media. 
        </p>
                    
        <h3>We’re same because we’re all unique</h3>
                    
        <p>
            The first problem arises with the nature of these website builders. There is no programmer doing the code for you – all the parts of every website that comes out of Wix, for example, are presets or templates. You can see this very easily for yourself; log into one of the aforementioned website builders and you are immediately prompted to select a pre-designed theme for your website.
        </p>

        <p>
            The issue with this is that any website that is made using these services lacks originality. Even though there are various customizability options available, none of them allows you to make your website grandly unique. The options for changing the look and feel of your website are much more finite than if you were to code it from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>
            This means, after a while, every website on the internet will be too similar for our brains to distinguish, causing the internet to become genuinely boring. That’s right, the internet may become boring. 
        </p>
                    
        <h3>Oh, really? Prove it.</h3>
                    
        <p>
            If you don’t believe that the internet needs to stay diverse, here are two links:  <a href="http://eatatmulberrys.wixsite.com/cafe">one</a> and <a href="http://2016.makemepulse.com/">two</a> . One of them is a link to a website built with a website builder, while the other was built with pure determination and creativity. Although the second website functions well, it’s nowhere near as attention-grabbing, fun and creative as the first. It’s like the difference between a mediocre book and a really, really good one. They may both tell stories, but it’s the good one that you remember.
        </p>
                    
        <p>
            This is a psychological concept. To keep your brain alert, there is a mechanism which causes you to forget about, or ignore things that you are used to. Let’s ask two questions to prove this. What does your house smell like to you? What might your house smell like to an alien? You probably said “Nothing” or “Normal” for the first question. For the second question, there really is no reason for your house to smell normal for an alien. Your house smells like humans (ewww, gross). You’ve just become used to the smell. 
        </p>
                    
        <p>
            So, if you keep browsing through pages that look similar, are not eye-catching and, design-wise, completely standard, you’ll start ignoring them. However, if you stumble upon a great looking, interactive page, regardless of the content, you’ll be more alert and interested, because it’s almost alien to you.
        </p>
                    
        <h3>The robots really will take over</h3>
                    
        <p>
            The second main disadvantage is to the people who do really work hard to make their websites stunning and original. Because it only takes a couple minutes to make a website using a service and because you require no skills to use such services, there are inevitably going to be many more websites made using Wix, Wordpress, etc. In fact, there already are.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This means that the brilliant websites, from the amazing creators, are becoming harder and harder to find. <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org/random-website-machine/random/">Here’s</a> a great way to show this. Click “New Random Website” about five times and try to find 5 differences in the design of each compared to the previous one. Design means layout, interactivity and navigation, not content or language.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The best websites are endangered. They may soon go extinct, because after a point, it would become fruitless to put in days of effort to make a unique website. Nobody would see it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Imagine trying to find a needle in a haystack. It’s a difficult task. Now imagine finding a needle in a haystack that is forever filling with more and more hay. That’s impossible. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        
        <p>
            Before you sign up to a website builder service, consider how building a website from scratch might benefit you: your website would look better (if you’ve spent enough time learning), causing your message to be better remembered and making you look more professional; you’re learning important skills which could be used any time in the future and finally, you’ll have full control over your website, from design to advertising.
